# Ball physics
###### Ball physics is a python project developed by William Espegren.

## Idea
1. Lightweight - A physics simulation running without the need to install packages other than python's already included packages
2. Simple - Simple logic with real world inputs, like gravity = 9.82 m/s^2.
3. Intuitive GUI - GUI where variables easily can be changed.
